- SBRapido TH Rear CW2_cutter magnet - Added slot for 6mm x 3mm magnet - recommend using high grade N52 magnets
- SBRapido UHF TH Front_cutter - extended legnth to accomodate the Phaetus Rapido Plus UHF for the Filamentrix Filament Cutter
- Cutting_Arm_Magnet - replaces the spring slot with a 6mm x 3mm magnet - recommend using high grade N52 magnets

*Note - May not require N52 magnets, but is recommended. If you do not get the appropriate level of retraction/repel, first verify that the
cutter arm does not have excess friction, you may need to spin a small round file inside of the cutter arm pivot hole. 

You will need to download the mainbody for the Clockwork-2 - available on the Filamentrix github - https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix

I make no gaurantee that this will work with the Rapido UHF, I'm still testing it out, and working through a few kinks. Recommendations are welcome!
